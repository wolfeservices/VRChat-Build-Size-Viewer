# VRChat Build Size Viewer
 A script for viewing the build size for VRC worlds and avatars after building.
 It's kinda ugly. So sorry about that. Made it for myself, but thought it might be handy for others!

## How To Use
- Just Import the .unitypackage 
- Go to Window/Muni/VRC Build Size Viewer.  
- Then build a world or an avatar in Unity, either for testing or upload.  
- Click Read Build Log.  
- TADA.
